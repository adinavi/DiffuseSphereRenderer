# Diffuse Sphere Renderer
A simple ray tracing project that demonstrates diffuse shading and lighting applied to a sphere. This project follows the principles of light interaction with surfaces, implementing a basic ray tracing algorithm to render a 3D sphere with realistic shading.

# Features
Ray-Sphere Intersection: Calculates the intersection points of rays with a sphere in 3D space.
Diffuse Shading: Implements Lambertian reflection to simulate diffuse lighting effects based on a single light source.
